Writing for me is where I feel most confident. (Already after saying that I'm prepared to make a thousand mistakes and the eyes of the reader will be even more aware of them). The page is where I feel like I can edit and revise but also where I'm most comfortable making mistakes. It's how I do my best communicating with family and friends. It's how I make my living (writing code, that is). It's where I have learned to think through tough problems and come to solid (or at least less liquid) conclusions.

Writing about tech is something that I've wanted to do forever. Maybe not forever but at least the past few years. And much like the big heavy weights at the gym, I've felt as if there's a blocker between me and _it_. As if the space those weights inhabit doesn't belong to me. It's taken me probably 9 to 10 years of rock climbing before finally breaching the invisible barrier to feel comfortable enough to slide on a few of those 25 pound round plastic blobs to those 45 pound bars and letting them drop (still not as loudly as my mostly male compatriots) and asking for help when they're too heavy.

And it took lots of trying and running away and failing to get to that point, whether it's because I'm chicken or because of systemic oppression and exclusion or because of something in between. So that's why I started this space. So I can rid myself of this ridiculous anxiety and engage in a space I have wanted to participate in for a very long time. I've been writing code for over five years. I have lots of thoughts! I know stuff! (And yet goodness do I know so little at the same time.)

So I started this. I wrote the backend in Rails, because it's easy, because it's quick, because there's solid patterns already established and why reinvent the wheel/rail if it's already there?

I wrote the frontend in React, because it's hot right now and because I'm so uncomfortable with it. I leveraged the snazzy Rails 5

    rails new --fizzbuzzsophia --webpack=react

command and typed a handful of webpack commands I found via the handy internet and voil√†! I was writing components and rendering views. I'm on the Site Reliability Engineering team at Betterment (caveat, all these thoughts are my own and don't represent the engineering team or the company at Betterment) and so I don't really have the chance to fiddle around with hot javascript frameworks. They're tons of fun. I'm glad I have a space to try them out.

I don't have a database. I did, but then I didn't want one. (At least, for now). I wrote a tiny almost meaningless generator to create timestamped directories and markdown files with the old `ARV[0]` as the name of the file. I don't have any tests yet. I should get those up and running. But I hope to spend some time messing around with mocha or whatever folk use to test their JS.

And lastly, I deploy it with Heroku, because Heroku makes managing infrastructure moot for small things like this.

I have ideas for this space. I'm interested in performance. In the things that make the observability of web applications easier, clearer and better. I hope to write about what I've done already in this space, and what I hope to do this year. I'm interested in reliable CI workflows. I'm interested in working together with other engineers to improve the speed and durability of web apps. I'm interested in Ruby. I'm beginning to be interested in go. There's a million things I want to write about.

Thanks for reading.
